# Scalable GP Inference

This repo contains my experiments for subsampling or kernel approximation methods for scalable GP inference.

For experiments, we use the regression datasets from the UCI repository, installed through the following command

```python -m pip install git+https://github.com/treforevans/uci_datasets.git```
