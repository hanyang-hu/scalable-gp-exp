# Scalable GP Inference

This repo contains my experiments for subsampling or kernel approximation methods for scalable GP inference.

Use the following command to install:

```python -m pip install .```

## Datasets

For experiments, we use the regression datasets from the UCI repository, installed through the following command:

```python -m pip install git+https://github.com/treforevans/uci_datasets.git```
